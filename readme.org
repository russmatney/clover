#+TITLE: Clover

Clover is a Clojurescript-based "Overlay" tool, intended to support transparent web
overlays while streaming to Twitch.

Initially implemented to support a floating transparent webview.

* Build and Run
To build the node-script:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
shadow-cljs release cli
#+END_SRC

This builds a ~clover.js~ in the root of the directory, which can then be
passed to electron via:

#+begin_src clojure
yarn electron clojure.js
#+end_src
